# Our Flow and questions :
Customer will need VM's with desired IP or not.
We will fetch MAC of all the VM's using dumpxml virsh dumpxml $VM-NAME | grep 'MAC'
We will change qemu/libvirt/network/*.xml IP address in specific subnet for a given MAC. virsh net-edit default*
Add IP if possible as desired by customer here
